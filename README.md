Craft Cloud Back End

Welcome to Craft Cloud!

A personal site to help you manage your current craft projects and crafting aspirations! This web app allows you to create craft categories and craft projects with any data you choose. Youâ€™re able to enter many details about the craft projects you add - name, image, link, description, difficulty, notes and completed. The app also allows you to edit and delete categories and crafts; those changes will be reflected both in the front end and in the Ruby/Active record backend. Both Categories and Crafts have full CRUD functionality.
